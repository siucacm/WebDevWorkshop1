Topics: Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


## HTML:

What is HTML?


HTML is a markup language used in developing web pages.


The building blocks of HTML web pages are called "elements", which are represented by tags.


### Syntax of a tag:


    <  element  >  <  /element  >


All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <  !DOCTYPE html  >.


The HTML document itself begins with <  html  > and ends with <  /html  >.


The visible part of the HTML document is between <  body  > and <  /body  >.


### Common elements:


     p: Paragraphs


     h(1-6): Headings


     a: Links


     img: Images


     button: Button


     ul/ol: Unordered/Ordered lists
     
     
     li: List elements


     div: Division in a web page




HTML Example:

    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <body>

            <h1>My First Heading</h1>

            <p>My first paragraph.</p>

            </body>
        </html>


## CSS:


What is CSS?


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define styles for a web page, such as color, size, etc.


### Three Ways to include CSS into your web page:


    Inline 


    Internal style sheet


    External style sheet


Form of a CSS internal or external style sheet:


     p{
          color: red;
          font-family: Times New Roman;
          font-weight: bold
        }
        
        
## JavaScript:


Where HTML and CSS are more for designing a web page, JavaScript is used for adding functionality to it.


Can be used when certain events take place on your web page or you want some event to occur. 


### Can be placed in three places:


    In the <  body  > section of an HTML file


    In the <  head  > section of an HTML file


    An external JavaScript document 
     
         
 Example of JavaScript function:
 
    <script>
        function myFunction() {
            alert('Hello World');
        }
    </script>
